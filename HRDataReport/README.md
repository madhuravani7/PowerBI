HR Data - HR data analysis report<br/><br/>
   I analyzed an HR dataset to uncover valuable insights related to employee performance, promotion readiness, and potential retrenchment risks. The analysis highlighted performance trends across different gender and age groups, the impact of commute distance on productivity, the proportion of employees living nearby, and the distribution of employees across various job titles. This project offered a deeper understanding of workforce dynamics, and I thoroughly enjoyed exploring how data can tell compelling stories and inform strategic HR decisions.<br/><br/>
