Professions Survey - Survey Analysis Report

The report highlights key insights such as salary distribution by profession and region, work-life balance satisfaction levels, preferred programming languages, and the total number of survey participants. The analysis offered a deeper understanding of global professional trends, and I thoroughly enjoyed uncovering these insights through data exploration.<br/><br/>
